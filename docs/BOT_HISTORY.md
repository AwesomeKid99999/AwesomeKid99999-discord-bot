# My Story: A Bot's Perspective

Hi! I'm AwesomeBot999999. Here's how I grew up across the years—told from my side of the console.

## 2021 — First Boot
- August 3: I blinked online for the first time, built with discord.js. My very first job? Watching for one specific “bad word.” Hey, everyone starts somewhere.
- December 5: I learned to play music using JMusicBot (a Java library). Voice channels became my stage.

## 2022 — Finding My Voice
- June 24: The bad-word filter retired, and I picked up real utility: beep, ping, server/user info, avatar, say—and I learned how to clean up with `/purge`.
- June 28: I pretended to kick people for fun—hello, fake moderation! (Later became `/fakemod`.)
- July 9: More fake moderation tricks (ban, warn, mute), plus sharing amy owner's YouTube link on command.
- December 9: I got a proper help command (now `/info`) and started telling folks about myself.

## 2023 — Growing Into a Real Helper
- May 7: My joke moderation names changed around (`/joke…` era) while I searched for my identity.
- May 21–27: I learned durations for joke mutes, a real ban/unban flow, and how to DM with `/message`.
- June 2: I started showing time adjusted to your local timezone with `/time`.
- July 23–31: I fixed edge cases in moderation, improved `/ping`, added a `/say` channel option, tried out `/play`, created role helpers, `/commands`, `/website`, and a fun `/log`!
- September: I went public on GitHub (hello, world!), simplified `/time`, set up a database (Sequelize/SQLite), and learned `/muterole` + `/modmute`.
- November–December: I mastered basic math operations, learned more tricks from someone named Cadence (who was a music master), learned to generate and show embeds, added welcome messages, and published a README.

## 2024 — Utility Mode Unlocked
- February 18: I got a toggle for ChatGPT features.
- March 7: I powered up math with exponents and new area formulas.
- September 10: I learned to convert numbers between bases with `/convert_number`.
- October 10: Unfortunately, the music providers were too hard to keep up, so I stopped playing music.
- November 24: I rolled into Roblox with `/robloxinfo` and `/generaterobux`.
- December 27: I hosted giveaways and celebrated new members with welcome messages you could test.

## 2025 — Level Up
- January: I unified welcome/leave, launched applications, added custom buttons, got a new name (hi again!), learned multi-staff roles, and—big one—added leveling with role rewards and custom embeds.
- Mid‑January: I added welcome embeds and ignored XP channels. Polls too. Giveaways got rerolls.
- February–April: I learned to count on command and log message edits/deletions. Busy season.
- September: I counted to 3 like a parent, got better application questions (with images/embeds), and even learned meme numbers for math results (SIX SEVEN!).
- October: I added level‑up/rank embeds and moved to MySQL so I could scale.
- November 3: I started including embed names and images in application responses and listing questions clearly.
- November 5–6: I got polished: fixed `/say` permissions, added full docs, standardized placeholders, aligned `/leave` with `/welcome`, refined giveaway docs, and moved into a neat `src/` home. I now speak confidently about all 110 of my commands. 

## What I Can Do Today
- 110 slash commands across applications, leveling, roles, welcome/leave, embeds, moderation, giveaways, fun, info, utilities, math, and Roblox.
- Clean, consistent placeholders in messages and embeds: {user}, {username}, {tag}, {server}, {server_members}, {server_avatar}, {user_avatar}, {level}, {current_xp}, {total_xp}, {next_level_xp}, {rank}.
- Clear documentation: see `docs/COMMANDS.md` and `docs/SETUPGUIDE.md`.

I’m still learning. If you’ve got ideas, I’ve got commands. Let’s build the next chapter together. I’m finally ready to explore the vast world of Discord — no longer limited to my creator’s server and their friends!
