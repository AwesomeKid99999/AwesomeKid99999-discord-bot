## Installation Guide

### 1. Create a Discord Application
1. Visit [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application**
3. Name it, accept the TOS, and go to the **Bot** tab.
4. Customize your bot’s name and avatar.
5. Click **Reset Token**, then copy the token to a `.env` file (use `.env.example` as a template).

> **Note:** Disable “Public Bot” if you want to limit invitations,  
> and **enable all Privileged Gateway Intents** (Presence, Server Members, Message Content).

### 2. Inviting the Bot
1.	Go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator** in your application settings. 
2. Under **Scopes**, check:
   - `bot` 
   - `applications.commands` (required for slash commands)
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, choose:
   - `Administrator` _(recommended for testing)_
4.	Copy the generated link and open it in a browser.
5.	Choose your server and invite the bot.

### 3. Initial Setup
1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Make a copy of the `.env.example` I provided and rename it to `.env`.
3. In the `.env` file, configure your client ID, token, and database:
   ```dotenv
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id-goes-here"
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-bot-token-goes-here"
   OWNER_WEBSITE="your-website-goes-here" # optional
   GITHUB_REPOSITORY="your-github-repository-goes-here" # optional
   DASHBOARD=""
   DATABASE_HOST="localhost" # or your remote host
   DATABASE_PORT="3306" # or your remote host's port
   DATABASE_NAME="database"
   DATABASE_USER="root" # or your remote host's username
   DATABASE_PASSWORD="your-password-goes-here"
   ```
4. Deploy commands using `npm run refreshCommands`. (Runs: `node src/deploy-commands.js`)
5. Create/sync the database using `npm run syncDatabase` (Runs: `node src/syncdb.js`) 
> Note: The `syncDatabase` script uses `sequelize.sync({ alter: true })` to safely update your database schema without deleting data.
6. Run the bot using `npm start`. (Runs: `node src/index.js`)
