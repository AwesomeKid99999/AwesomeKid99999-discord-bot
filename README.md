***__This README is still a work in progress.__***

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js version 22.12.0+](https://nodejs.org/en)
- A Discord account

## Setting up the bot
First, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications to create an application. Click on the "New Application" button. Enter a name and accept the Discord Developer TOS and Developer Policy. Then go to Bot and customize it however you want. Reset your token and copy it into a .env file. (I included an example env file so you can remove ".example" for your own) Turn off "Public Bot" if you don't want anyone else to invite your bot to servers. Turn on all Privileged Gateway Intents. 

## Inviting the bot
To invite the bot to your server, go to OAuth2 → URL Generator. Since it's an all-in-one bot, you can set it to have administrator permissions. Select the bot scope and copy the URL and paste it into another tab. When you go to the website, it will ask you which server you want to invite the bot to. Select your server from the list.
